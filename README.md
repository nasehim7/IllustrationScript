# IllustrationScript
This repository contains a script which is able to retreive dominant keywords from the inputted text and provide relevant images from the database associated with those keywords. The script is linked to MySQL database as of now but with appropriate changes in the code can be made to work on any other system. I will make the edit here in the README file about the structure of the Database and how data should be injected in the database. I will make folders for each step but as of now only a single script is uploaded. it's well commented and understandable.
